# Python Cache Directory

This directory contains compiled Python bytecode files automatically generated by the Python interpreter.

## Contents:

- `.pyc` files: Compiled Python bytecode for faster loading
- May include version-specific bytecode (e.g., `module.cpython-39.pyc`)

## Purpose:

Python creates these files to:
- Speed up module loading by caching compiled bytecode
- Avoid recompiling unchanged Python source files
- Optimize import performance

## Important Notes:

- This directory is automatically managed by Python
- Files are regenerated when source files change
- Contents should not be manually edited
- This directory should be excluded from version control (included in `.gitignore`)
- Different Python versions create different cache files

For more information, see the [Python documentation on the import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#cached-bytecode).
