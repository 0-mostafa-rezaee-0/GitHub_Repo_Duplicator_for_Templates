# Build Artifacts Directory

This directory contains build artifacts generated by PyInstaller when creating standalone executables for the GitHub Repository Duplicator.

## Contents:

- Compiled Python modules
- Cached bytecode
- Runtime dependencies
- `localpycs/`: Local Python cache files used by PyInstaller

## Important Notes:

- This directory is automatically generated during the build process
- Do not manually edit files in this directory
- Contents should not be committed to version control
- The directory is recreated with each build

## Build Process Information

These files are intermediate artifacts from the PyInstaller build process, which:
1. Collects Python modules and dependencies
2. Compiles them to optimized bytecode
3. Packages them into a standalone executable

For more information on the build process, see the PyInstaller documentation and the `.spec` file in the parent directory.
