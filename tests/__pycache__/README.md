# Tests Cache Directory

This directory contains compiled Python bytecode files for test modules, automatically generated by the Python interpreter.

## Contents:

- `.pyc` files: Compiled Python bytecode of test files
- Version-specific bytecode cache files

## Purpose:

These cache files are created when running tests to:
- Speed up test execution by caching compiled bytecode
- Avoid recompiling unchanged test files between runs
- Optimize import performance during testing

## Important Notes:

- This directory is automatically managed by Python
- Contents are regenerated when test files change
- Files should not be manually edited
- This directory should be excluded from version control (included in `.gitignore`)
- Different Python versions create different cache files

For more information on Python's bytecode caching, see the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#cached-bytecode).
